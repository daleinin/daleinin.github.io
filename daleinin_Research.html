      <p class="hom_mainp"> Broadly, my interests lie at the intersection of Differential Geometry, Algebraic Topology, Partial Differential Equations, and applications to Physics. That is, using the tools of Algebraic Toplogy to understand smooth invariants of smooth manifolds with the aim of relating them to solution sets of PDEs and thereby solutions to phyiscal systems.
      </p>
      <p class="hom_mainp">
	Specifically, the goal of my work is to contribute to the study of deRham Cohomology Theory in general, and its intepretation as counting solutions sets to PDEs via the Hodge Theorem in particular. The strategy is to apply some of the more recent developments from Algebraic Topology, namely recent categorifications of graph polynomials, to the classic deRham Cohomology Theory in order to extend its abilities to detect more subtle structures of smooth manifolds.
