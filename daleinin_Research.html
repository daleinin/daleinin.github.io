      <p class="hom_mainp"> I am currently engaged in two projects. <br>
	One is computational, the other theoretical.
      </p>
      <ul class="hom_mainp">
	<li><strong>Computational</strong> </li>
      First, I am working to apply recently developed techniques and technologies in the field of topological data analysis to problems in machine learning. Image classifiers (computer vision in general) are a common application of machine learning methods. However, they can be easy to overtrain and difficult to generalize to novel datasets since they primarly analyize images at the level of pixels.
	<br>
	<br>
	Topological data analysis leverages the power of algebraic topology to analize datasets by computing topological invariants of the data. The topological invariants have the advantage of being homotopy invariant (robust under pertubations of the data) and also global (characteristic of the entire image not just the individual pixels). Correctly integrating these topological invariants into a machine learning model is expected to increase the robustness and generalizability of such models.
      </ul>

      <ul class="hom_mainp">
	<li><strong>Theoretical</strong> </li>
	For my second project, the goal is to fill in some of the missing pieces in the recent theory of categorified graph polynomials. Namely, the chromatic polynomial for graphs has been categorified both algebraically and geometrically. While some results have been obtained in both respects as well as some results relating the two, there are still many open questions.
	<br>
	<br>
	Namely, do graph morphisms induce morphisms in the algebraic categorification? How might we interpret the geometric categorification in terms of differential forms (and thereby solutions to differential equations)? What, if any, duality results hold for the algebraic categorification and do the carry over to they geometric side of things?
	<br>
	<br>
	These are a few of the questions on which I am currently working.
      </ul>
<!--       <ul class="hom_mainp">
	 Below are a few of my research notes on these topics.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	
	<li> <a href="Research_Docs/Research_Notes.pdf" target="blank" class="sidebar_link"> <b>Composite de Rham and Chromatic Cohomology</b> </a> </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> This document begins with a review of the categorification of the chromatic polynomial via the state sum formula. It then discusses how to apply the resulting complex to smooth manifolds by inserting the de Rham complex of differential forms into the construction. It ends with an example of the resulting bicomplex. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>

       <li> <a href="Research_Docs/Composite_Cohomology_Differentials.pdf" target="blank" class="sidebar_link"> <b>The Differentials of the Bicomplex</b> </a> </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> This document first establishes the explicit definitions of the differentials which appear in the bicomplex. It then goes on to establish some  basic properties of the differentials inlcuding commutativity and squaring to zero. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li> <a href="Research_Docs/The_Chromatic_Differential_Factors.pdf" target="blank" class="sidebar_link"> <b>Factoring the Chromatic Differential</b> </a> </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> This document describes a factorization of the chromatic differential as the composition of the Kunneth Homomorphism and the pullback under the embedding map of the diagonal into the product manifold. This factorization makes clear how the chromatic complex encodes information about diagonals in the graph configuration space of the the manifold. </li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<li> <a href="Research_Docs/P1_R1_Computation.pdf" target="blank" class="sidebar_link"> <b>A Simple Example Computation</b> </a> </li>
	<ul>
	  <li> This document contains a detailed computation of the first two pages of the resulting spectral sequence in the case in which the manifold is the real line and the graph is given by two vertices connected by one edge. </li>
	</ul>
